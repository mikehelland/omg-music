        <h3>What is "open music"?</h3>

        <p>It's open source applied to music.</p>
        <p>You could download a compiled app, or you could download the source code</p>
        <p>Now apply that to music. Instead of getting the finished MP3, you get the individual samples and control over the mixer.</p>
        <p>You can change the tempo, the key, the levels, the FX, and the individual notes.</p>
