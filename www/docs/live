<p>Users can connect with other users and devices in a few different ways, which can be combined.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Join Mode</h3>

<p>In this mode, one user goes live, and one or more users will join them. 
All joined devices make sound. This is for connecting users and devices in different 
geographic locations.</p>

<ul>
        <li>Step 1: a user "goes live".</li>
        <ul>
                <li>Click <a href="/create?goLive">Go Live</a> on the <a href="/live.htm">Live Page</a></li>
                - or - 
                <li>Turn on the "Live Button", in the settings in OMG Create.</li>
                <li>Click "Go Live!""</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Step 2: other users join at "https://openmusic.gallery/create?join=[user]"</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Remote Mode</h3>

<p>In this mode, one user goes live, and one or more devices act as remote controllers 
for the session. The remote controllers don't make sounds. This is for when users and devices are in the same
room.</p>

<ul>
        <li>Step 1: a user "goes live".</li>
        <ul>
                <li>Click <a href="/create?goLive">Go Live</a> on the <a href="/live.htm">Live Page</a></li>
                - or - 
                <li>Turn on the "Live Button", in the settings in OMG Create.</li>
                <li>Click "Go Live!""</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Step 2: other users join at "https://openmusic.gallery/create?remoteTo=[user]"</li>
</ul>

<p>This is how the Touchscreen Guitar and the Techno Gauntlet works.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Audience Mode</h3>

<p>In this mode, one user goes live with a single part, and one or more users can contribute to that part.
If multiple users are connected, melodies that include a note for each input are played. In a live 
situation this mode allows the audience to use their mobile devices to become part of the performance.

        <li>Step 1: Turn on OMG Live for a part.</li>
