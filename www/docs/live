<p>You can connect with other users and devices in different combinable ways.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Join Mode</h3>

<p>In this mode, one user goes live, and other users join them. 
All joined devices make sound. This is for connecting users and devices in different places.</p>

<ul>
        <li>Step 1: <i>user1</i> "goes live".</li>
        <ul>
                <li>Click <a href="/create?goLive">Go Live</a> on the <a href="/live.htm">Live Page</a></li>
                - or - 
                <li>Turn on the "Live Button", in the settings in OMG Create.</li>
                <li>Click "Go Live!""</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Step 2: other users join at:</li>
        <ul><li>https://openmusic.gallery/create?join=<i>user1</i></li></ul>
</ul>

Example:
<ul>
        <li>User 1: goes live from Seattle</li>
        <li>User 2: joins from New York</li>
        <li>User 3: joins from Paris</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Controller Mode</h3>

<p>This is for users and devices in the same room. 
One device goes live, and others can act like game controllers. The controllers don't make sounds. </p>

<ul>
        <li>Step 1: <i>user1</i> "goes live".</li>
        <ul>
                <li>Click <a href="/create?goLive">Go Live</a> on the <a href="/live.htm">Live Page</a></li>
                - or - 
                <li>Turn on the "Live Button", in the settings in OMG Create.</li>
                <li>Click "Go Live!""</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Step 2: controller devices go to:</li> 
        <ul><li>https://openmusic.gallery/create?controller=[user]</li></ul>
        </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Example 1: Home Entertainment</h3>
<p>You and your mates decide what to watch next. Instead, you decide to jam. Someone puts OMG Create
on the TV or computer, and goes live. Everyone in the room can use their phone to control the music.</p>

<h3>Example 2: Futuristic Instruments</h3>

<p>You want to build a 21st century instrument like the Touchscreen Guitar or a Techno Gauntlet. 
Combine whatever smart devices you have around to control all aspects of music, and conduct them
 like a symphony. </p>

<hr>

<h3>Audience Mode</h3>

<p>In this mode, one user goes live with a single part, and one or more users can contribute to that part.
If multiple users are connected, melodies that include a note for each input are played. In a live 
situation this mode allows the audience to use their mobile devices to become part of the performance.
</p>

<ul>
        <li>Step 1: Turn on OMG Live for a part.</li>
        <ul>
                <li>Choose a part, such as Sine Oscillator, and click the &#9776;</li>
                <li>Click the Options Tab</li>
                <li>Click "Go Live!""</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Step 2: other users join at "https://openmusic.gallery/live/[user]-[partName]"</li>
</ul>
